                  for flexible external field dimensions within a given maximum
                  and minimum width and length. These dimensions should be adhered
                  to for all fields used by 
                  teams under 12 and older.

                  yards.Leagues, districts or associations participating in the
                  state competition program that are unable to provide a field
                  that meets these minimum requirements must advise the State
                  Competition Board which will assign its Fields Committee to
                  inspect the field and recommend to the Board whether or not a
                  waiver of the minimum dimensions should be granted. Teams from
                  leagues, districts or associations that are unable to provide an
                  acceptable field may be required to play all their games away.
